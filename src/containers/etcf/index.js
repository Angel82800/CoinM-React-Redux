                    unique investment strategy developed by the CoinMetro team. Our team of professional investors hand-picks
                    baskets of digital assets and groups them into an ETCF. With one click, you can diversify your portfolio
                    into multiple tokens through an ETCF.

                <p>
                    ETCF’s are designed to make it easy for users to diversify their portfolios, as well as to provide
                    liquidity to new tokens that enter the CoinMetro marketplace, working in tandem with our ICO
                    Express platform. In addition to being able to diversify into specific industries, like IoT, finance, or
                    healthcare, users will also be able to invest in a fund based on its risk profile, or even the
                    social media influencer scores of tokens grouped inside the fund.
